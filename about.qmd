NB: This course is the continuation of a multi-year collaboration between Professor Harold D. Clarke and Professor Robert W. Walker.  Owing to Professor Clarke's passing in January of 2022, the course is now solely instructed by Robert W. Walker.

**Harold D. Clarke** was Ashbel Smith Professor in the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas, and adjunct Professor, Department of Government, University of Essex. His current research interests focus on the political economy of party support. He has published widely on this topic in journals such as the American Journal of Political Science, American Political Science Review, and British Journal of Political Science. He is chief editor of Electoral Studies. He has been a principal investigator for the 2001, 2005 and 2010 British Election Study (University of Essex and University of Texas at Dallas), the 2011 Political Support in Canada Study, and the 2012 Political Support in America Study. His most recent books are Brexitâ€”Why Britain Voted to Leave the European Union (Cambridge University Press, 2017), Affluence, Austerity and Electoral Change in Britain (Cambridge University Press, 2013), and Austerity and Political Choice in Britain (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015).

**Robert W. Walker** is Associate Professor of Quantitative Methods in the Atkinson Graduate School of Management at Willamette University. He earned a Ph. D. in political science from the University of Rochester in 2005 and has previously held teaching positions at Dartmouth College, Rice University, Texas A&M University, and Washington University in Saint Louis. His current research develops and applies semi-Markov processes to time-series, cross-section data in international relations and international/comparative political economy. He teaches courses in quantitative methods/applied statistics and microeconomic strategy and previously taught four iterations in the U. S. National Science Foundation funded Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models sequence at Washington University in Saint Louis.  His work with Curt Signorino and Muhammet Bas was awarded the Miller Prize for the best article in Political Analysis in 2009.
