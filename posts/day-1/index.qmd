# Code and Analysis

[The data are in Stata format.](https://github.com/robertwwalker/Essex-Data/raw/master/ISQ99-Essex.dta)  The `github` for this course.  There is also [a link here for a local copy](./slides/ISQ99-Essex.dta).

## Basic R commands

```{r}
library(haven); library(kableExtra)
HR.Data <- read_dta(url("https://github.com/robertwwalker/DADMStuff/raw/master/ISQ99-Essex.dta"))
library(skimr)
skim(HR.Data) %>% kable() %>% scroll_box(width="80%", height="50%")
```

## More R summary

A little function that I wrote up on `github`.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plm)
source(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertwwalker/DADMStuff/master/xtsum.R"))
# Be careful with the ID variable, the safest is to make it factor; this can go wildly wrong
xtsum(IDORIGIN~., data=HR.Data) %>% kable() %>% scroll_box(width="80%", height="50%")
```

## The Core Idea

In R, this is an essential `group_by` calculation in the `tidyverse`.  The within data is the overall data with group means subtracted.

```{r}
HR.Data %>% 
  group_by(IDORIGIN) %>% 
  mutate(DEMOC.Centered = 
           DEMOC3 - mean(DEMOC3, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  filter(IDORIGIN==42) %>% 
  select(IDORIGIN, YEAR, DEMOC3, DEMOC.Centered) 
```

In Stata, the key is to first load and declare the data.

```
use "https://github.com/robertwwalker/Essex-Data/raw/main/ISQ99-Essex.dta"
des
```

![Stata Load](./slides/StataLoad.png)

`xtset` denotes two key features of the data, the $i$ and $t$.

```
xtset IDORIGIN YEAR
```

![xtset](./slides/xtset.png)

Stata has internal capabilities for summarising and describing `xt` data.  A between and within summary is given by `xtsum`

```
xtsum
```

![xtsum](./slides/xtsum.png)

The description can be deceptive **because the indices are a complete grid.**

```
xtdes
```

# Leads and Lags

The core operators in Stata lead with a letter before `.`  With panel data, we will need to be cautious of the grouping.

- F is forward, 
- L is Lag, 
- D is difference.

## Qualitative Variables

### `xttab`

- Between: How many units received each category?
- Within: Of all observations of units that received that category at least once, what percent of observations take this value?

```
xttab AINEW
```

![xttab](./slides/xttab.png)

### The Between

```{r}
between.tally <- function(x) {
HR.Data %>% select(IDORIGIN, AINEW) %>% filter(AINEW==x) %$% table(IDORIGIN) %>% length()
}
sapply(c(1:5), function(x) {between.tally(x)})
```

### `xttrans`

A first-order transition matrix.

```
xttrans AINEW
```

![xttrans](./slides/xttrans.png)
I want to rely on the `dplyr` version of lag so I am explicit here.  Take the data, group it by id, calculate the lag, ungroup them, and create a table.  The `janitor` library provides `tabyl` and it is explicit among missing values.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(janitor)
HR.Data %>% 
  group_by(IDORIGIN) %>% 
  mutate(Lag.AI = dplyr::lag(AINEW, n=1L, order_by = YEAR)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  tabyl(Lag.AI, AINEW)
```
