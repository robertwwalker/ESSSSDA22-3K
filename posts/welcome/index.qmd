# Welcome to 3K: Dynamics and Heterogeneity!

I hope you are ready! 

In the next two weeks we will set forth as comprehensive a treatment as we can in time series and panel data in ten sessions.  With coffee in hand and the computer getting ready, let's dig in!

# Digital Resources

Depending upon your software of choice, you will want to have a look over the relevant manuals.
- For Stata [ts](https://www.stata.com/manuals/ts.pdf) and [xt](https://www.stata.com/manuals/xt.pdf)
- For R there is [timetk](https://business-science.github.io/timetk/) and [fpp3](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) and [plm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plm/vignettes/A_plmPackage.html) along with [panelr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/panelr/vignettes/wbm.html).

## A Useful Model Translator

[The Social Science Computing Cooperative at the University of Wisconsin has a nice, albeit incomplete, rendition of model compatibilities with syntax in R and Stata.](https://www.sscc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/Rmisc/panelmodels.html)


## Topics of Interest Cut by Time

We will read selections from a broader controversy in *Political Analysis*  on Time Series and error correction models; [the full list of papers can be found here as a large part of the Winter 2016 issue 24(1)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/issue/BEBF2602B7601618A0EA1D40B9AC4DDE).  

There is [a digital special issue of *Political Analysis* on Regression Discontinuity and Time Series Cross-Section data.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/special-collections/panel-data-analysis-and-regression-discontinuity)  For day 6 of the class, [the paper by Plumper and Troeger (2019) about fixed effects regression is definitely worth considering.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/not-so-harmless-after-all-the-fixedeffects-model/5DD67D1D95F573B11EB189BA72338854)

Factor augmented dynamic panel data models get an interesting treatment in [Dynamic Panel Analysis under Cross-Sectional Dependence by Khusrav Gaibulloev, Todd Sandler and Donggyu Sul](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/dynamic-panel-analysis-under-crosssectional-dependence/88101DECF0F2804EF7E8AE2EEC53127F)
